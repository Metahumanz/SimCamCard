# AI Changes

Use one section per AI-assisted change.

## Template

### Date
YYYY-MM-DD

### Task
Small, bounded task.

### Context Provided
- spec file(s)
- source file(s)
- relevant test(s)

### Constraints
- architecture/interface constraints
- files that must not change

### AI Changes
- changed files
- behavior implemented

### Verification
- tests run
- manual checks
- result

### Regression
- existing tests rerun
- regressions found/fixed

### Human Decision
Accepted / Rejected / Revised

## 2026-09-29 — Observation baseline update

### Task
Incrementally update the Week 1 SDD evidence after additional black-box observation.

### New verified behavior
- T16: group deletion.
- T18: persistence after full quit and relaunch.
- T19: successful save to system Contacts and field mapping.

### Documentation changes
- Filled reference environment values supplied by the student.
- Updated Reference Test Suite statuses.
- Updated state inventory.
- Added newly retained evidence screenshots.
- Removed T16/T18/T19 from the remaining observation-gap list.

### Human verification
The student manually performed the reference-app interactions and confirmed the observed results.

## 2026-09-29 — T20 negative-sample observation update

### Task
Record fixed exception/negative samples for T20.

### New verified behavior
- Minimal card containing only name + mobile produces only those structured fields.
- A valid non-card landscape image did not trigger a dedicated recognition-failure dialog in CamCard 8.63.1; it entered Edit Card with an empty recognition result.

### Specification impact
- Missing fields must remain empty and must not be fabricated.
- Do not invent a recognition-failure UI when the reference version instead exposes an empty editable result.
- Preserve cancel/back/retake and permission-recovery as regression cases.

### Human verification
The student manually imported both fixed samples and captured the resulting CamCard screens.
